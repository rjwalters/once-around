    description: "An ancient constellation, Lupus represents a wild animal (not necessarily a wolf originally) that Centaurus is about to sacrifice on the altar Ara. The remnant of SN 1006, the brightest supernova in recorded history, lies in Lupus—it was visible in daylight for weeks. Several of Lupus's stars are members of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association."

    description: "A small, faint constellation created by Lacaille to represent a pair of compasses (the drafting tool), Circinus lies near Alpha Centauri. Despite its obscurity, it contains the Circinus Galaxy—one of the nearest Seyfert galaxies and one of the brightest in the infrared sky. X-ray binaries and other active objects have been found within it."

    description: "Created by Lacaille to honor the octant (a navigational instrument predating the sextant), Octans contains the south celestial pole. Unlike the north pole with bright Polaris nearby, the south pole has only the faint Sigma Octantis (magnitude 5.4) as a pole star—barely visible to the naked eye and not useful for navigation."

    description: "Not to be confused with the much larger Hydra, Hydrus is a southern constellation created by Keyser and de Houtman. It lies between the two Magellanic Clouds. Beta Hydri is notable as one of the oldest stars in the solar neighborhood and as the nearest reasonably bright star to the south celestial pole. The constellation represents a small water snake."
